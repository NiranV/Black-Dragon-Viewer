Its often used for BDSM, locks, collars and other restraining actions, which was the reason why it was called Restrained Life, but just because its mainly used for BDSM its not bad. Its API can also be used to create powerful and really cool Role-play games or HUD's , it can even be used to create automatic outfit wear and un-wear scripts! so don't hesitate to try it out!
