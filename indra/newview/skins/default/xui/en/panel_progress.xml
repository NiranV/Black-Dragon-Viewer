You can also add additional buttons or delete buttons if you wish , just right click on an active button and click 'Select Buttons' , this will open a Window in which you can drag and drop all buttons where you want them!</string>
  <string name="LoadingTip 2">Lighting and Shadows is also known as Deferred. Deferred Rendering is an advanced graphic rendering used in a lot of games today as example Crysis 2 , StarCraft 2 and Grand Theft Auto 4</string>

  <string name="LoadingTip 7">This Viewer is based on Linden Lab's 3.6 codebase. It includes Server Side Baking/Appearance and the Materials Project.</string>
  <string name="LoadingTip 8">You can open a second Inventory window by clicking at 'File' at the top of the Inventory window and then selecting 'New Inventory Window'.</string>
  <string name="LoadingTip 9">This Viewer supports RLVa, its a good way to live out your 'controlling' side , its often used for BDSM , locks , collars and other restraining actions , the reason why it was called Restrained Life but just because its mainly used for BDSM its not bad its API can also be used to create powerfull and really cool Roleplay games or HUD's , it can even be used to create automatic outfit wear and unwear scripts! so dont hesitiate to try it out! if you dont like it you can always disable it in Preferences -> RLVa , but you will need a relog.</string>-->
  <!--<string name="LoadingTip 9">[#9] This Viewer currently doesnt support RLVa anymore since RLVa is not up to date and might cause issues with the currently targeted Linden Source Code.</string>-->
  <string name="LoadingTip 10">Your 'People' window acts as recent chatter list , radar , friend and group list. You can start an IM Session by double clicking your friend or someone in the radar, on group it will open and start a group chat conversation.</string>

  <string name="LoadingTip 13">This Viewer is aimed at high graphic defaults , delivering you a fairly good graphic preset for every graphic level right from stock!</string>
  <string name="LoadingTip 14">Black Dragon supports Color Grading , Tone Mapping and Vignette known from Exodus Viewer and has Gamma Correction by default now due to the Materials Project. You should really try those out if you have a good Computer that is able to handle Deferred aswell. You can find those Options in Preferences -> Display.</string>
  <string name="LoadingTip 15">Keep in mind that alot of problems can often be solved by the simpliest things , like cleaning your cache. Sometimes you sadly need bigger calibers ... you will have to delete your settings then , you should always keep a backup of them however.</string>
  <string name="LoadingTip 16">Mesh is a cool new , faster and higher detailed way to customize your Avatar. Be sure to check them out on the Marketplace! Dragon -> Marketplace. Be warned , not everything shiny is valueable , try Demo's before you buy the full item.</string>
  <string name="LoadingTip 17">This Viewer offers alot Options to customize your Viewer appearance , you can find alot of them regarding the main interface in Preferences -> Interface.</string>
  <string name="LoadingTip 18">Take your time while exploring the Viewer , look into all corners , slowly work from panel to panel , you will find a lot of Options to customise a lot of different aspects.</string>
  <string name="LoadingTip 19">Do you think Groupchat popups are annoying and fill your screen? Disable them! Preferences -> Chat.</string>
